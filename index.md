# Hello, Hola, Hallo

I will be adding some cool stuff, so stick around.

## So what's the point of it?

I'm looking to improve my technical ability and dive into areas that I have little experience in.

## Tech is cool

But I can also find it very difficult at time, and frustrating, I need to remember by staying cool things will get much cooler in turn!

- Breath
- Reflect
- **Have FUN**

### Things that are important to me
1. Family
2. Technology
3. Faith 
4. Optimism (Need to work on this one)

### Here is a funny dog
look at him isn't he terrifying
